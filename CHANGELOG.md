## [PR#26](https://github.com/brabster/xubuntu-workstation/pull/26) [2024-05-20]

### Added

-   **Passwordless `sudo` for Update Script**: The `update` script can now be executed via `sudo update` without requiring a password, making routine system maintenance more convenient. (#26)

### Security

-   **Threat Model Assessment for Passwordless Updates**: A threat model assessment was conducted for the passwordless `sudo` feature. The conclusion is that this change represents a **net decrease in overall risk**. (#26)
    -   **Rationale**: While it introduces a minor theoretical risk (an attacker with user-level access can trigger a system update), this is heavily mitigated because the script itself is owned by `root` and cannot be modified by the user.
    -   **Benefit**: The removal of friction for a routine, safe task encourages more frequent system updates. This tangible improvement in security posture outweighs the minor introduced risk.
