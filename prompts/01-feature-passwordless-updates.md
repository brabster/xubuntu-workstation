### Phase 1: Analysis and Implementation Plan

1.  **Objective**: I will modify the Ansible configuration to allow the user to run the `update` script via `sudo` without being prompted for a password. This enhances convenience for a routine, safe operation.

2.  **Plan**:
    1.  I will target the `roles/updates/tasks/main.yml` file, which contains the sudoers configuration for the update script.
    2.  I will modify the `ansible.builtin.lineinfile` task that manages the sudoers entry for the `updaters` group.
    3.  I will add the `NOPASSWD:` directive to the rule, specifically granting passwordless execution for the `update_script`.

3.  **Rationale**: The `update` script is a trusted, non-interactive script managed by Ansible. Granting passwordless access for this single command is a reasonable trade-off for user convenience, as it doesn't grant broad `sudo` privileges. The change is narrowly scoped and adheres to the principle of least privilege. The existing `validate` directive using `visudo` will ensure the change doesn't break the sudoers file.

### Phase 2: Code Implementation

I will modify a single file to implement this feature. Here is the change in the unified diff format.

```diff
--- a/roles/updates/tasks/main.yml
+++ b/roles/updates/tasks/main.yml

+    line: '%updaters {{ ansible_hostname }}=NOPASSWD: {{ update_script }}'

```

### Phase 3: Verification and Testing Plan

You can use the following commands to validate the changes on your workstation.

1.  **Static Analysis (Linting)**:
    Run the linter to check for any syntax issues.
    ```bash
    ansible-lint workstation.yml
    ```

2.  **Dry Run (Check Mode)**:
    This command will show you what changes would be made to `/etc/sudoers` without actually applying them.
    ```bash
    ansible-playbook workstation.yml --check --diff --tags updates
    ```
    You should see a change reported for the `lineinfile` task.

3.  **Live Execution**:
    Apply the change to your system.
    ```bash
    ansible-playbook workstation.yml --tags updates
    ```

4.  **Post-Execution Verification**:
    After the playbook completes, verify that the change works as expected.

    *   Check that the `update` command can be run without a password:
        ```bash
        sudo update
        ```
        *(This should execute without a password prompt.)*

    *   Confirm that other `sudo` commands still require a password:
        ```bash
        sudo ls /root
        ```
        *(This should still prompt for your password.)*

    *   Inspect the sudoers file to see the new rule:
        ```bash
        sudo grep updaters /etc/sudoers
        ```
        *(The output should contain the `NOPASSWD:` directive.)*
