### Phase 1: Analysis and Implementation Plan

1.  **Objective**: To systematically resolve the 52 ansible-lint violations in the codebase. This will improve the project's security, reliability, and adherence to Ansible best practices.

2.  **Plan**: I will methodically correct each category of violation across the affected files.

    *   **`risky-file-permissions`**: I will explicitly set file and directory permissions by adding the `mode` attribute to the relevant tasks. I'll use `'0644'` for files and `'0755'` for directories.
    *   **`yaml` Violations**: I will correct formatting issues, including removing extra blank lines, ensuring files end with a newline, quoting octal values (e.g., `'0755'`), fixing indentation, removing trailing spaces, and replacing truthy values like `yes` with the boolean `true`.
    *   **`no-changed-when`**: To ensure idempotency, I will add `changed_when: false` to tasks that use the `command` or `shell` module where the command's output doesn't reliably indicate a change. For installation tasks, I will add a check to see if the application is already installed.
    *   **`name[casing]`**: I will correct task names to start with an uppercase letter.
    *   **`fqcn[action-core]`**: I will update tasks to use Fully Qualified Collection Names (FQCN) for all built-in Ansible modules (e.g., `ansible.builtin.file`).
    *   **`syntax-check[unknown-module]`**: I will correct the misspelled module `ansible.builtin.sysctl`.
    *   **`workstation.yml` Refactoring**:
        *   I will add a `name` to the main playbook execution.
        *   The `become_method` will be corrected to `sudo`.
        *   I will remove the `./roles/` path prefix from all role definitions and fix the indentation.

3.  **Rationale**: Addressing these linting violations is crucial for maintaining a high-quality, secure, and maintainable Ansible project. Using FQCNs, ensuring idempotency, and setting correct file permissions are foundational Ansible best practices that lead to more predictable and robust automation.

### Phase 2: Code Implementation

I will proceed with the code modifications, reading each file and applying the necessary fixes.

### Phase 3: Verification and Testing Plan

1.  **Static Analysis (Linting)**:
    *   `ansible-lint workstation.yml`
2.  **Dry Run (Check Mode)**:
    *   `ansible-playbook workstation.yml --check --diff`
3.  **Live Execution**:
    *   `ansible-playbook workstation.yml`
